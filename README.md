# IWAnno
IWAnno is a scene-level and sensor-adaptive semantic segmentation framework for oceanic internal wave detection in multi-source satellite imagery.

The source code will be publicly released upon final publication of the associated manuscript.

The multi-sensor full-scene internal wave dataset is currently being organized and will be released in stages after publication, together with detailed documentation.
